# Classifier for Network Intrusion Detection
This semester I attended the lecture Machine Learning for
security by the [Intelligent System Security Group at KIT](https://intellisec.de/teaching/#). The lecture was a lot of fun and I would definitely
recommend it. 

I created this project to apply some of the theoretical knowledge learned. 

## The task
Building a Predictive Model to callsify Network Attacks.
The task is to categorize each sample as one of five classes
- bening
- dos
- r2l
- u2r
- probe

## The data
The dataset used is the NSL-KDD dataset, it is an improvement
to the classic network intrusion detection dataset from the 1999 KDD Cup.

## The models
- TODO
