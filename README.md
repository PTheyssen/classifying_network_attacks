# Classifier for Network Intrusion Detection
This semester I attended the lecture Machine Learning for
security by the [Intelligent System Security Group at KIT](https://intellisec.de/teaching/#). The lecture was a lot of fun and I would definitely
recommend it. 

I created this project to apply some of the theoretical knowledge learned. 

## The task
Building a Predictive Model to classify Network Attacks. 
Original task [description](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/task.html)

The task is to categorize each sample as one of five classes
- benign 
- dos (denial of service)
- r2l (Unauthorized accesses from remote servers)
- u2r (privilege escalation attempts)
- probe (brute-force probing attacks)

## The data
The dataset used is the NSL-KDD dataset, it is an improvement
to the classic network intrusion detection dataset from the 1999 KDD Cup.

## The models
- TODO
